                <p id= "intro">Hi. I'm Natalia Lopez. I was born and raised in Cali,Colombia. I am 16 years old and I'm currently a Junior at Southwest CTA. My program area is Web Design and the reason why I choose it was because I was always curious on how websites worked. It's been an amazing experience so far and I have enjoyed every moment of it. I have the ability to speak two languages English and Spanish, fluent in both. I have always pushed myself into doing what I want. I never stop until achiving my goal. Throughout my high school experience, I have gained knowledge that has prepared me to face the world. I have been able to solve problems under pressure and still be able to succeed.
