            <p>Content Knowledge</p>
            <p>During my freshman year, I had the opportunity to learn how to use a program called Illustrator. It was during Fall 2013. I was able to learn amazing techniques that helped me create this masterpiece. We were given approximately 2 months to work on this project. In my Graphic Design class, we started of by learning the names of each tool and doing small activities, that later on, helped me finish my-self portrait. I started by tracing the picture I decided to work on. The hardest part of this PBL was putting values on the picture to make it look realistic. It was hard to add all the details on the picture. However, this PBL helped me gained knowledge that was really useful on creating graphics.

            <p>Writing Skills</p>
            <p id="debate">This project was one of the last PBLs of my freshman year. It was during Spring 2013. Throughout the year we had been gaining skills to prepare us for this debate. We learned about fallacies before the debate to help us point out any fallacies during the debate. We were assigned groups of four, then, we had to pick a partner from the group to help during the debate. We had to pick a topic that had pros and cons, however, all the team members had to be interested. Our topic was Medical Progress depends on animal research, my partner and I looked at the good things about animal research and also at the bad things so we could have a backup the day of the presentation. We found a lot of interesting facts that were going to help us the day of our presentation but sometimes we found a lot of fallacies in some facts. We worked on this project for about a month and we helped each other so we could have different facts. The day of our presentation everything went well because we had backups to all the things the opposite team said and that made our debate stronger. I'm really thankful for having the opportunity to have this PBL during my freshman year because it helped me with my presentation skills. It helped me be confident on presentations.

            <p>Work Ethic</p>
            <p>It was during Winter 2013. All around the world we find issues that have increased lately. Most of these issues affect teenagers in different ways. The purpose of this PBL was to learn of these issues and know how to prevent it or get through it. My group consisted of three people and the issue we choose was teen suicide. We were required to create a campaign to bring awareness of this issue. Some of the requirements were to create a slogan, create 3 items to bring awareness, and a take-away item. For our slogan we did “Before it's too late” and it tied well with our topic. We decided to make a video to bring awareness, a yellow ribbon as our take-away item, and posters that would be put in the hallway. As a group we helped each other on whatever we needed. I made around 10 posters and I put 1 or 2 in each building of the school. We made around 100 yellow ribbons and as a group we helped with editing the video. The day of our presentation students from SWCTA, staff, administration, and teachers came to the gallery walk which took place in the ballroom. Our presentation was successful and we had a lot of students interested in our campaign. All the take-away items which were the ribbons were gone by the end of the gallery walk.

            <p>Use of resources</p>
            <p id="cells">My biology teacher Mr. Goode taught us about cells and on how to use a microscope. It was during Winter 2013. The thigns he taught us were really helpful for our PBL which was about cells. We were put on groups of 4-6 people and we were assigned to research 3 different types of cells. We had to prepare and record all our data and put it on a PowerPoint or Prezi. The cells had to demonstrate beauty, shape, cell color, and other characteristics. We were also required to type essays on how to use a microscope and how to prepare a slide. We looked at apple skin, grape skin, flowers, dirty water, leafs, mold, onions, and other items. As a group we were assigned to bring at least 3 items every day so we could explore through all those items and find amazing cells. Also, our group decided to put the best cells in a PowerPoint that we presented to the whole class. I also learned to communicate with my team and being patience was the hardest thing from this experience.

            <p>Collaboration</p>
            <p>In my English class, we learned about mythology and the hero's journey. We put our knowledge to practice by working on a PBL of 3-4 people per group. It was during Spring 2013. Then we were assigned a hero from the Greek mythology. My group was assigned Hercules which was the hardest of all the heroes since he traveled a lot. We were required to have a map to show where he went and why. We were also required to explain the hero's journey and have illustrations for all the twelve trials that were given to Hercules. As a group, we decided to do a poster instead of making a PowerPoint or Prezi online, we taught it was easier for all of us to work on it. We started by making the map and doing the research of where he went and why. We divided the work equally and we had a leader to be checking up upon the work given to the other team members. The hardest part of the PBL was doing the research since there's so many points of view from the same story. It was also a challenge to have the correct information for the hero's journey. As a team, we all collaborated to complete the project. Every team member took the poster home to work on it and finish their part. This was the last project given to us as 9th graders.

            <p>Proffessional Presentation</p>
            <p id="spokenWord">This was my favorite PBL from all the projects I had my freshman year. It was during Fall 2013. My english teacher taught us about all the different types of Spoken Words there are in the world. Our teacher also taught us about figurative language, attributes, and being resilience so we could make our Spoken Work interesting. This project was about making a Spoken Word about our life's and connecting that with a family member and a historical figure that had gone through the same situation as I had. We were also required to pick an attribute to describe our whole Spoken Word. I picked to interview my mom and I picked Anne Frank as my historical figure because we had gone through changes in our life's that made us stronger. After we had our Spoken Word done we had to say it to other people so they could give us feedback, from the feedback everyone said it was nice but that I needed to slow down. The day of the presentation everything went well and I got a good grade.
